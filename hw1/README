This is a database of important characters from Game of Thrones. In addition to individual characteristics, each character is a member of one or more houses. A House is a familial unit with numerous members. A character is part of at least one house but can also gain membership in other houses by marriage. There is a many-to-many relationship between characters and houses. Each house occupies one or more 'seats', castles or cities where their leadership is based. Every house has an ancestral seat and may also occupy other seats by conquest. The royal house also controls the royal seat at King's Landing. A seat can be attached to multiple houses if it is the ancestral seat of one house but is occupied by another house. Thus there is a many-to-many relationship between houses and seats.

The data in this database is based on G.R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire". The information was taken from the Game of Thrones wiki and was transcribed into a comma-delimited .csv file and loaded into sqlite3. Characters, Houses, and Seats all represent unique semantic entities and were put into separate tables. Join tables between Characters and Houses, and Houses and Seats, were constructed to represent the relationships between these entities. Although Characters and Seats are somewhat connected, because Characters can live in seats, there is too much movement between different locations for such a Join to be meaningful. This information is better encapsulated through finding which house a character belongs to, then finding where this house is seated. Only major characters, locations, and groups from the television show were included, so this database is by no means exhaustive.
